**Fiction Writer** helps you work with large files by splitting then in single ones

![Split](img/split_file_01.gif)

There are several options for splitting files

- **Split Document Here (at line)**: will take everything from current line, to the end of the file and will move to another file
- **Split Document Here (at cursor)**: will take everithing from the cursor position, to the end of the file and will move it to another file
- **Move Selected Text to New Document**: will extract the selected text to a new file

## Naming

- When splitting, files will be named as follows:
- if there is no selected text, then the current document name will be taken, and an ending number will be added:
- Example: 
```
File: big_file.md
Becomes: big_file.md and big_file-1.md
If you continue splitting, the new files will be big_file-2.md, big_file-3.md, and so on...
```

- if you select a part of the text, that text will be the name of the new file:
- Example:
```
File: big_file.md
Selection: you select Chapter 1 text, and split
Becomes: big_file.md and chapter_1.md (as the name is taken from the selection)
```
