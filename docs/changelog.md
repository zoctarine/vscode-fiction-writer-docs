## Known issues

- As this plugin rebinds some keys, like:<kbd>enter</kbd>, <kbd>shift</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>, <kbd>delete</kbd>, <kbd>tab</kbd>, <kbd>backspace</kbd>, it can interfere with other extensions that also overwrite this key bindings.

- Consider inspecting and rebinding some of them, as described here: [Key Bindings for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings)
