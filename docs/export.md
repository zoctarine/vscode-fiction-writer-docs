**Fiction Writer** helps you export markdown documents to other formats, by integrating **Pandoc** in the writing flow.

![Export01](img/export_01.gif)

# Requirements

!!! danger "Important!"
    If you want to compile `.md` to other document formats using this extension, you need to have [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) installed on your machine, and configured to run from command line! 

Pandoc is a universal document converter, that understands a large number of useful markdown syntax extensions, including document metadata (title, author, date); footnotes; tables; etc.

You can get it from here: [Installing pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html).

You can test that pandoc is properly installed by opening your prefered command-line app and running:

```
pandoc --version
```

You should get an output similar to:
```

pandoc 2.11.4
Compiled with pandoc-types 1.22, texmath 0.12.1, skylighting 0.10.2,
citeproc 0.3.0.5, ipynb 0.1.0.1

# Markdown flavors - _COMING IN NEXT ALPHA RELEASE_

As exporting is done by using Pandoc, all Pandoc related markdown flavors can be used.

Note that Pandoc already includes a list of enabled extensions. You can read more about these here [Pandoc's Markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown).

There are some extensions that are not included by default, but they can be enabled via settings panel.

Read more about the following extensions here: [Non Pandc Extensions](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#non-pandoc-extensions)
  
- `attributes`: allows attributes to be attached to any inline or block-level element.

- `old_dashes`: Selects the pandoc <= 1.8.2.1 behavior for parsing smart dashes: - before a numeral is an en-dash, and -- is an em-dash. This option only has an effect if smart is enabled.

- `angle_brackets_escapable`: Allow `<` and `>` to be backslash-escaped

- `lists_without_preceding_blankline`: Allow a list to occur right after a paragraph, with no intervening blank space. 

- `four_space_rule`: Selects the pandoc <= 2.0 behavior for parsing lists, so that four spaces indent are needed for list item continuation paragraphs.

- `spaced_reference_links`: Allow whitespace between the two components of a reference link, for example,

- `hard_line_breaks`: Causes all newlines within a paragraph to be interpreted as hard line breaks instead of spaces.

- `ignore_line_breaks`: Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being treated as spaces or as hard line breaks.

- `east_asian_line_breaks`: Causes newlines within a paragraph to be ignored, rather than being treated as spaces or as hard line breaks

- `emoji`: Parses textual emojis like :smile: as Unicode emoticons.

- `tex_math_single_backslash`: Causes anything between `\(` and `\)` to be interpreted as inline TeX math, and anything between `\[` and `\]` to be interpreted as display TeX math.

- `tex_math_double_backslash`: Causes anything between `\\(` and `\\)` to be interpreted as inline TeX math, and anything between `\\[` and `\\]` to be interpreted as display TeX math.

- `markdown_attribute`: Markdown is only parsed inside block-level tags if the tags have the attribute `markdown=1`.

- `mmd_title_block`: Enables a MultiMarkdown style title block at the top of the document. If `pandoc_title_block` or `yaml_metadata_block` is enabled, it will take precedence over `mmd_title_block`.

- `abbreviations`: Parses PHP Markdown Extra abbreviation keys, like

- `autolink_bare_uris`: Makes all absolute URIs into links, even when not surrounded by pointy braces <...>.

- `mmd_link_attributes`: Parses multimarkdown style key-value attributes on link and image references. This extension should not be confused with the link_attributes extension.

- `mmd_header_identifiers`: Parses multimarkdown style heading identifiers (in square brackets, after the heading but before any trailing #s in an ATX heading).

- `compact_definition_lists`: Activates the definition list syntax of pandoc 1.12.x and earlier.

- `gutenberg`: Use Project Gutenberg conventions for plain output: all-caps for strong emphasis, surround by underscores for regular emphasis, add extra blank space around headings.

- `sourcepos`: Include source position attributes when parsing commonmark. For elements that accept attributes, a data-pos attribute is added; other elements are placed in a surrounding Div or Span elemnet with a data-pos attribute.

# Including other documents

??? setting "Export > Include: Enabled"
    - Key: `fictionWriter.export.include.enabled`
    - Enables the include file functionality
    - Default: `enabled`

This extension adds support for combining multiple markdown documents into one.

You can use the following syntax `{file_to_include.md}` the the contents of `file_to_include.md` will be added in the exported document.

Specifying included files can be done in multiple ways.

## Include by aboslute or relative path

A valid path to the file:

- like a relative path

    ```yaml
    {my_file.md}
    ```
    or
    ```yaml
    {relative/path/to/my_file.md}
    ```

- or an absolute path

    ```yaml
    {c:\MyBook\Chapter1\my_file.md}
    ```

## Include by metadata `id`

!!! info "This is the recommended way to include files, as it does not depend on the filename"

If the document has a metadata block with `id` top level field, this can be used in the include file syntax `{}`

For example, if `my_file.md` has the following contents:

```yaml
---
id: prologue
---

Prologue begins here...
```

You can include it in another file like this:

```yaml
# Prologue

{prologue}
```


## Resolve document `id`

??? setting "Export > Include: Search Document Ids in All Opened Files And Workspaces"
    - Key: `fictionWriter.export.include.searchDocumentIdsInAllOpenFilesAndWorkspaces`
    - Default: `disabled`

if you opt to include a file by `id`, and not by relative or absolute path, you have the option to search for that `id` only in the document workspace folder, or in all opened documents or worskpaces in Visual Studio Code.

By default, this option is `disabled`


## Include errors

??? setting "Export > Include: Show Errors in Output File"
    - Key: `fictionWriter.export.include.showsErrorInOutputFile`
    - Adds errors to the compiled document.
    - Default: `enabled`

If, during the export process, some errors occured, they will be shown in a warning message before the actual export takes place.

![Error01](img/export_errors_01.jpg)

You can choose to continue (with errors) or cancel the operation.

By default, include errors are visible in the exported document in **Error** paragraphs, like this:

![Error02](img/export_errors_02.jpg)

Disable this option if you want to never see errors in exported document.

## The `toc` document

A common practice is to have just one TOC document, where you include all other documents.

A simple `toc.md` document can look like this:

```yaml
{chapter01.md}
{chapter02.md}
{chapter03.md}
{chapter04.md}
```
This will include all 4 referenced files.

Of course a TOC document can contain any additional markdown syntax:

```md

# My Book Title

## Preface

Some opening words

## Chapter One

{chapter01.md}

## Chapter Tso

{chapter02.md}

## The End

This is the end.
```

If `{chapter01.md}` does not exist, you will get a warning message, but the exporting can still continue with the other documents.

For example, the `toc.md` from the following directory:
```
.
├─ toc.md
├─ prologue.md
├─ part1
│  ├─ ch1.md
│  ├─ ch2.md
│  └─ ch3.md
├─ part2/
│  ├─ ch4.md/
│  └─ ch5.md
└─ epilogue.md
```

could look like:

```md
{prologue.md}

{part1\ch1.md}
{part1\ch2.md}
{part1\ch3.md}

{part2\ch4.md}
{part2\ch5.md}

{epilogue.md}
```


# Commands

## Compile Current File

*documentation coming soon...*

## Compile Selected files

Compiles all selected markdown documents (having `.md` extension) from current directory, into one file.

The include order is filename order.

*documentation coming soon...*

## Compile TOC

Exports the TOC file.

A TOC file is a simple `.md` file that serves as a table of contents for exporting. The file-name can be configured under `fictionWriter.export.tocFilename`.

By default, the `toc.md` file-name will be used. 

If the TOC file is searched for in two locations:

- first, in the same folder as the opened document
- second, in the workspace root.

If no TOC files is found in either location, then compile will fail.

**Example:**
```
.
├─ toc.md          # The toc.md in workspace root
├─ part1
│  ├─ chapter1.md
│  ├─ chapter2.md
│  └─ toc.md        # The toc.md from part.1
├─ part2/
│  ├─ chapter3.md/
│  └─ chapter4.md
```

- if `chapter1.md` is opened, and **Compile toc.md** command is run, then `/part1/toc.md` will be used.

- if `chapter4.md` is opened, and **Compile toc.md** command is run, then `/toc.md` from workspace root will be used.
